The noteboook 'classification.ipynb' implements Intent Classification.
The model used here is Random Forest.
Accuracy of 95% is obtained on the test set.

The data used in the notebook can be found here: https://github.com/clinc/oos-eval
Here the 'data_full.json' is used.

In order to implement the notebook, install dependent libraries using requirements.txt
Next, run all the cells in the notebook - this will train the model again and save it.
If you want to use the pre-trained model again on the test, implements last cell.
